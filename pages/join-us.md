Yotsuba Society is currently understaffed. We have plenty of goals to accomplish and a lot of stuff to do, however we need a lot help to do so. It's a volunteer job, so you won't get paid but the rewards of helping preserve and study the western imageboard culture will be more than worth it.

The application can be viewed and filled out in [this Google Form.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dENwaUZBajh2WjU3ckE5bjNDbjQwclE6MQ#gid=0).

After the application has been filled, expect an interview by me or by a admin within 1-2 days. If we for some reason forgotten about you, email us.
