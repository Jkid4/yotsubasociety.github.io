**Browser addons, extensions, and userscripts.**

4chan X, a userscript for that makes various tasks easier and faster, like dumping directories of images, reporting posts, hiding threads, in-page image loading, ect. It also watches threads for new bumps and is very light on your system. Since it's a script you can tweak it however you want. People have also talked about re-writing it to work with sites other than 4chan. My personal favourite. But you can find more userscripts for 4chan here.  
4chan Firefox Addon, pretty much does what 4chan X does but is a bit heavier and has a right-click menu that lets you navigate 4chans boards.  
4chan Chrome Addon, same thing as the 4chan Firefox Extension but for SRWare Iron and Google Chrome.

**Other useful software and tools, both to install on your computer, or run from the web.**
