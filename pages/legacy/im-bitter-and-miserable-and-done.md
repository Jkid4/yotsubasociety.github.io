I'm done. I'm so done. Seriously with the persistent harassment and stalking from savetheinternet's leetchan, my clinical depression which has now relapsed due to recent events, and the fact that I'm unable to get a job in my field or any field related to my interest (with $25,000 student loan debt, along with other debts from credit cards), there is no point maintaining this website without any income. I simply can't afford it anymore.
The site's purpose was to study and preserve the 4chan and its chanverse it's created. Despite my many achievements and its many setbacks, even recently with the shutdown of the Yotsuba Society Archives, at least I did something to make my mark. 

* The largest 4chan and imageboard archive than chanarchive.org (Which is now dead as well)
* The restoration of wikichan until it was vandalized and shutdown.

Despite these achievements: I funded this website with practically out of my pocket. Despite donation buttons, no one donated a single cent. 
NO ONE. When the archives was taken down, I only got a few emails thanking me. I did not get any emails thanking me when the archive was still active. 
Proving that people only care about things they know until they're gone.

Sadly, my problems interfering with the normal functioning of the website I've simply had it. I just can't do it anymore. I've powered through enough, and I'm bitter and miserable. Even if I get a job I will be still bitter and miserable from the entire ordeal.

I'm sorry. Please don't give me any positive thinking/please don't give up messages. I'm simply done. I'm very close to not attend any anime cons as well, due to my unstable situation. 

If you're really sorry for me, why not actually help. Do something

If I don't receive any donations to this site via this bitcoin address that will make sure the site last for another or a grand miracle does not happens before January 28th, 2014. Yotsuba Society is dead for good.
