The following are the people behind Yotsuba Society, aka Team Yotsuba Society (Team YS).

## Primary Administrators of Yotsuba Society

### Ndubuisi “Jkid” Okeh (Jkid !yYT/u4PSNE)

Position: Co-Owner, Co-Founder, and Head Chanthropologist

A No Social Life King, Jkid entered the *chan scene mid-2008 with 4chan as “Anonymous of College Park, MD”and frequently visted /g/, /r9k/, /cgl/, and /n/. After establishing a known reputation in /cgl/ for about two years, he was outed by another tripfag as Jkid and subsequently adopted the username. He has plenty of knowledge of the site and the imageboard culture due to his years of lurking and manually archiving threads, not only from 4chan but from many other *chans. He’s currently dedicated to the preservation of the Western Imageboard Culture by all means because he feels that people take imageboards for granted.

### Ottre (Ottre) Content Manager

A channer who spends most of his time on 2ch.so, which is Russia’s largest imageboard. (Yes, imageboards do exist in Russia). Not only his time in those imageboards taught him much about Russian imageboard culture, they taught him the importance of preserving *chan culture, as they were the first to archive their boards. He’s particularly interested in imageboards that are disappeared from the internet and international imageboards. He also spends time on 99chan’s /b/, and krautchan’s /int/.
