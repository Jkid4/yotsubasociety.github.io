After a few weeks I've finally managed to upload the entire video of the presentation onto YouTube. The entire panel, uncensored and uncut. This is the first time I've recorded my own panels at any anime convention and I wanted to do it since my second panel at Katsucon. Anyway the video can be viewed here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9ecYuHMKI
