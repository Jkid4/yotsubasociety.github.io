Around the last few weeks, the Yotsuba Society Archives were launnched with a few screencaps and a two threads from /v/. However, on On Saturday April 23rd 2011 I've added in a bunch of old threads I discovered online a long time ago, into the Yotsuba Society Archives. These threads were made well after 4chanâ€™s Anime/Random (/ab/) board  was changed to Random. But even after the name change, it was heavily focused on anime and Japanese culture. Anime such as Digimon and Neon Genesis Evagelion were mentioned. Even a thread of 4chan catchphrases were used at the time period.   Also there is a mix of modern threads from the election day 2008.

Please note that since /b/ is considered not safe for work, the /b/ archive is the same as well. If you want to add anything to the Yotsuba Society Archives, email us at yotsubasocietycontact[at]gmail.com

Thanks and enjoy the site.
