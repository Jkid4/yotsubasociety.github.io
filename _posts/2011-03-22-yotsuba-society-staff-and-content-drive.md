Currently Yotsuba Society is doing two drives. The first one is for historians and archivers for the site, please note that these are not paid positions and are completely volunteer positions: 

<b>Yotsuba Society Historians</b>

Yotsuba Society Historians research and analyze the content, culture, and historical events of the Western Imageboard culture. A goal for each historian is to produce one major paper per month, along with a small article once per week based on the imageboard culture, history, or topics releated to or interests related to imageboards (such as anime, japanese culture, general interests, etc). In addition, they should be able to to write a short, one page paper on any thread or material they deem essential to YS for the archives. 

In addition, they research the *chan culture and history via the internet and the threads provided by the Archivers or via their own gathering. They also expected to interact and cooperate with other historians and archivers of YS. Historians are not moderators, but they do have access to a private staff board and have access to a ## YS Historian capcode. Historians once hired will be general historians. After six months, they can elect to become a resident historian. 

Sparky4 is not only Yotsuba Society's first Historian, he's our first Honorary Historian

<b>Yotsuba Society Archivers</b>

Yotsuba Society Archivers maintain the Yotsuba Society Archives, which contains threads from the imageboards, textboards, and irc chatlogs, and anything related to the Western Imageboard Culture. A major requirement is to make research notes and categorize each thread possible for historians to view and analyze to help make their papers. In addition, they receive saved threads and images from the various imageboards from other channers and then store them, make copies of threads they receive from various sources via any means, such as CD or DVD discs, or an external hard drive. 

Archivers are not moderators, but do have access to a private staff board and have access to a ## YS Archivist capcode. Archivers will first start off as general archivers, then they can focus on one imageboard and/or site after six months. 

Already grey from the Otakutalk.org site has just joined up as YS's first archiver.
