For the first time ever, Yotusba Society will do a full review of the known Chanverse. Looking at major each board of every major chan and where possible every major minor chan. From Page 15 to the front page. We will briefly talk about the usual content, the images, the culture, and moderation patterns of each board and site. During the review I will be reviewing some threads from those chans. I want to know what really makes the difference between the chans and the boards. What drives them, and what reference it can made to the real world, or is it the reverse?

Comparisons will be made to the board's state between the present and the past since we have thousands of threads from all the chan's I've been to in the past. So we know what has changed and what hasn't.
