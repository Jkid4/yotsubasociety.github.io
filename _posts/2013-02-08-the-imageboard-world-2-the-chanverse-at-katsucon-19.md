For third time in a row in Katsucon, I’m personally pleased to announce that we are back with the third panel that Yotsuba Society has held in an anime convention. The panel will be a lot detailed (and enjoyable) than the previous panel. Not only will we update you with what happened after the last panel, we will give you more expanded information on not only 4chan, but the English chanverse, and the international chanverse, especially the large and unknown Russian chanverse of 2ch.hk as well. We will also give you a few surprises regarding what is actually goes behind the scenes of 4chan and its founder “moot” and a few surprises that Yotsuba Society has in store as well.

Sadly this panel is at late at night, but its well worth it to see what is going on. And for those who are into 4chan, you’ll get to see that there is a whole chanverse beyond /b/.
