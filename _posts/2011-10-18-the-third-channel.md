As the Founder of Yotsuba Society, it's a great pleasure that I'm finally publishing The Third Channel to the Yotsuba Society Front Page. Along with the Second Channel, this paper should have been published months ago before Otakon 2011. However, various complications prevented that from happening. And again, I have to finish what I've started. And just like The Second Paper, it's in a downloadable PDF file.

I have to thank Ottre and IsharaYar for helping me with these papers. I hope you find this paper enjoyable. Due to the length of the article, a text article would not do it justice, so I've decided to do a PDF copy of the article for you to download.

And if you want to discuss this or any other articles in the front page, feel free to visit our imageboard at www.yschan.org. More specifically we have a /ys/- Yotsuba Society board fully available to talk about the articles.

10/19/2011 Edit: sparky4 informed me about the minor mistake regarding the naming of Futaba Channel in the paper.
