Shortly after the creation of the Yotsuba Society Websites in 2011 I applied to do a panel for Katsucon 17. The panel was called “The Imageboard World”. It was held by me, my co-founder Xantar, Charizard, and another person called Nostalgia. I was a basic panel about imageboards, a few pictures here and then of the front pages of the *chans, and one stage about “Stages of a Channer” from one of my articles. A few people attended, and for some reason Katsucon liked my panel.

At the time I also dressed as Anonymous but named as Toshiaki after the Futaba channel regular anonymous user. That in that panel and for the other panel I will mention; only about ten or eight people came.

Come 2012, Katsucon 18: I presented “The Chanverse – A Introduction to the Imageboard World”. With just me presenting, since Xantar was on-call doing a rave on Saturday-Sunday at the same convention. That panel was “version two” of the original panel. It expanded in detail about the chanverse including the protochannels, 2channel, futaba channel, and lot more on 4chan and an introduction to the Russian chanverse, which to this day we are the only ones who are trying to survey it. We also included a bit of information about krautchan, /int/ and the Polandball and its resulting Country balls.

Now, after sitting in my unorganized archives for years, I’m putting up the PowerPoint files to just see how far the panels went and for those who did not have a chance to see these panels. Consider this a taste for what’s to come tomorrow.
