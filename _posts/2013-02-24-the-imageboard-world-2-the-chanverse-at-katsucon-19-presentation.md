On Sunday at 3am, I finally had my panel for Katsucon 19. Despite the fact that I only had few people going to the panel and a three phone calls by a known group of cyberyobs, it was relatively quiet despite the new information featured in the thread. But there was something that made my panel a lot better: A /sp/artan tripfag known as The Brotherman from 4chan who was originally a ot/a/ku came to the panel, who talked about the 2010 incident. No not the Otakon 2010 incident, but the 2010 incident around the South African world cup. Lots of newbies in that time came to /sp/ because of the world cup.

Anyway I will post the full video of the panel real soon featuring his appearance, however here are the full powerpoint presentation of the third panel:
