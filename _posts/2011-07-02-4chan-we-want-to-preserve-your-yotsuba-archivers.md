On Saturday, July 2, 2011, green-oval.com has transferred  the /a/ archive to easymodo.com. However from a source close to Yotsuba Society, it appears that green-oval.com is planning to close down its archival site for good. If it’s true, then an entire history worth of threads from /g/, /sci/, /lit/, and /tv/ may be gone forever. In addition /co/ has also been removed from the green-oval archives as well.  

Yotsuba Society wants to maintain, at minimum, a read only archive of those 4chan boards. Dedicated servers costs $100-$200 per month, and we are currently a startup site so we are not self-funding as of yet. However 4channers, if you really want your archives preserved, we will preserve them. Unlike 4chan, we will accept donations of money or assistance to retrieve the data from green-oval. Even better, if we get about $1,000 by the next two weeks it would be enough to keep the archives and any other archives we will take over if possible for the next six months.

Donations can be made by Paypal to the address ysjkid@gmail.com. This address is not only for donation of funds to preserve the archivers, but for the general running of Yotsuba Society in general. We have big plans for the Society and for YSchan, but it’s impossible without funding.

Spread the word, don’t let the archives disappear forever.
