A full briefing on the Russian Chanverse is forthcoming, so here's a bit of a taste to what's to come.

Introduction
•	Why it was formed?
•	Most media is effectively state-controlled, with the exception of Russia Today.
•	Much completely culture, more focused on anime and has an active meme culture.
•	Little information in English. Most of the information is in lurkmore.ru and dramatica.ua
•	Based on 4chan but it eventually evolved into it’s own chanverse.
•	There are five major chans: 2ch.hk is the largest primarily due to it’s legacy.
•	Very anal about archvial.

Brief History
•	2ch.ru came first
•	Elitists, /b/tards, Animefags, and normals
•	Amount of people increased dramatically
•	Iichan.hk was for animefags and elitists founded 0chan
•	The amount of spam and cp and morons was so much that 2ch.ru creator killed it’s own site. Was reborn as 2-ch.ru
•	Imageboard war was commenced between 2-ch.ru and 0chan
•	Russians eventually stuck at krautchan’s int /int/
•	“Due to some retarded laws, many sites were banned if some illegal content (pedo, terrorism, suicide) was found. It could've been even a single random image (they banned Google for several days, for fucks sake, they're completely incompetent). So I think 2ch.so got banned too and they changed the domain.” (http://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/77888096/#q77890052)



Fun Facts
•	Bridge to Tabathia is very popular
•	A TO or “And Then!” is a forced meme around December 29 2009 (http://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/29136518/#q29136587)
•	The Oppressor

2ch.hk: (“Welcome back. Again.”)

•	2ch.hk (aka Sosach, Hikkach, Dvach.so, piratach, pratcham, tirech, dvatirech.) – Most visited mediaboard in the runet.
•	Begun to gain popularity in May 2009. Triech tried to position itself as a full replacement as ofl dvachu. 
•	Most of Triech culture comes from and Dvach.
•	2ch.hk already has their own numbering system for /vg/ like threads before 4chan created it’s own /vg/ board.
•	2ch.hk is probably the most normalfag chan out there at this point. (http://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/77888096/#77889998)
