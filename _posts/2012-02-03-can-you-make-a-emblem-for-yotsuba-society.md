Yotsuba Society is interested in having a emblem. I already have an idea for one which is the following:

*Upper left corner: A portion of the flag of Japan
*Upper right corner: The colors red, white, blue, yellow, and black representing the flag stripes of the Western Countries.
*Lower left corner: A flower pot with two leaves
*Lower right corner: A clover hair strand of Yotsuba character from "Yotsuba&"
*Center of the four quadrants: A Circle with a White question mark.
*Surrounding the four quadrants: The Words "THE SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY AND PRESERVATION OF YOTSUBA CHANNEL - MMXI"

There is a seperate smaller emblem for the YSchan as well.

Here's the result.

And the color version:

Crappy, is it? I'm not a very good artist, so I'm asking you folks can you make a emblem based on those two images or a even better emblem? Contact us at yotsubasocietycontact@gmail.com or at my email address at ysjkid@gmail.com
