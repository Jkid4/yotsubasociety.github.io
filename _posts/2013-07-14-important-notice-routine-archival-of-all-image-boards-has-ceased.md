When Yotsuba Society was first launched, I was the only person who was routinely archiving 4chan and other image board threads manually with Firefox and DownThemAll. I've been doing this since 2008. It was a lot easy for me since I was in university, and most of my social life outside of anime conventions, cinema movies, and university events were in my dorm room watching British television I've downloaded off the internet and reading and saving 4chan threads I was interested. At the time it was only around 20 boards, and I can easily view and read them all and just save them. 

Five years later the growth of the image board scene has grown dramatically, and with 4chan alone there has been more boards than in 2008. Eventually with the end of my university days in 2012, and my transition to the work place it’s impossible to be around my computer to archive important threads. Especially on boards that are pink, but are important such as /pol/.
For the most part I’ve been maintaining Yotsuba Society with a lot of help from my assistants where possible. For those five years this site has been a one man operation mostly. And because of the massive backlog of needs and a backlog of threads to be actually put into the archive database and the under-staffing of YS, I have no other choice but to stop routinely archiving threads effective immediately. 

This includes the proposed “Review of the Chanverse” I've announced on May 4, 2013. 

However, this will allow me to revamp the archive database and possibly make a new coat of paint for the archive front-page. Possibly make it more pretty. Besides I’m already understaffed as it is.

Believe it or not it is not really a hard decision when you think about it. The 4chan community has its own fuuka archviers for most if not all work safe boards and some nsfw boards. Some of them maintain images while other does not.

Yotsuba Society will focus on making articles and special content along with articles that I want to publish but can’t. Primarily because dealing with cyberyobs sucks up any motivation of doing it. 

Seriously what’s the point if they screw up your plans?
