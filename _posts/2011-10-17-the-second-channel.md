As the Founder of Yotsuba Society it's a great pleasure that I'm finally publishing The Second Channel to the Yotsuba Society Front Page. It's been a long time coming. As a matter of fact, this paper should have been published months ago. I was planning to have it published before Otakon 2011, but due to various complications it was not possible. In the end, I have to finish what I've started. But I have to thank Ottre and IsharaYar for helping me with these papers. Due to the length of the article, a text article would not do it justice, so I've decided to do a PDF copy of the article for you to download.

I hope you find this an enjoyable read.
