Missed the 2012 Super Bowl? I did, I was more into collecting threads about the 2012 NFL Super Bowl than actually watching it. Besides I don't watch much TV and since I'm hopelessly unemployable there's no need to watch a sporting game advertising me stuff I can't buy.

Anyway, /sp/ threads about the game are lot more entertaining than watching the Super Bowl itself. So I've saved as many threads of it as I can. There's all in the Yotsuba Society Archives: http://archives.yotsubasociety.org/4chan/SuperBowl2012.rar

Enjoy
