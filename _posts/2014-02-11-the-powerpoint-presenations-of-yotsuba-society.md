Yotsuba Society held three panels at the anime/Japanese culture convention Katsucon from 2011-2013. Each one having a separate panel. Many youtubers/redditors/4channers/russians may know YS by this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9ecYuHMKI

But even since then I've never released the panel power-point presentations until now:

All of three panels presentations are available to view at your pleasure.
