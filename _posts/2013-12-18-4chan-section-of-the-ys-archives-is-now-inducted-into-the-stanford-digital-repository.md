Yesterday on 12/17/2013 a very important piece of 4chan history has been inducted on a website. But not just any 4chan history, but six years of 4chan history from 2007 to 2013. The 4chan section of the Yotsuba Society Archives is now available at the Stanford Digital Repository, at Standard University in California. 

Stanford University is one of the world's leading research and teaching institutions in the world, and how this happened? Around October 10th 2013 I contacted @DigiArchivist regarding my archives. He referred my collection to Henry Lowood (@Liebenwalde) Curator of History of Science & Technology and Film & Media collections at Standford. I allowed him to induct the 4chan section in their archive as a way to preserve the legacy of Yotsuba Society.

It took them over two months and the result is that all of the 4chan archives of Yotsuba Society is available to download at their website: http://purl.stanford.edu/tf565pz4260

Sadly while this is a massive resume booster, it will make me even more overqualified in this joke of a job market.
