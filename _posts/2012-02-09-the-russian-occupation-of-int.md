On February 4th 2012, 4chan's international board was invaded by Russian channers. Regulars to the board were confused with all the foregin trollfaces they're seeing and the different alphabet they're reading. Some don't mind the russians, some want them out, and some don't care. The role 4chan is playing while being a receiving website of sorts for Russian channer refugees, has huge implications in the real world. Currently as of this writing 2ch.so, the primary imageboard for the Russian Federation is down due to a DDoS attack by loyalists of President Putin's party.


<b>A brief timeline.</b>

*1/31/2012. Someone, known as Op_Russia claim that he have 16Gb e-mails of leaders russian youth movement Nashi who is aligned with Putin’s political party.

*2/1/2012. A person posted a .rar with mails on a file-hosting site. However, after 15-20 minutes the file was uploaded, it was deleted by a website administration.
Evening of 2/1/2012 to 2/2/2012. The .rar file started upload through P2P networks.

*2/2/2012 - 2/3/2012. Russian anonymous hackavists start researching the emails in .rar file, along with some bloggers and journalists and find some compromising information about the government. Journalists too to informed anyone with this information in Mass Media. However, all russian mass media was silent about that fail of Nashi.

*Evening of 2/3/2012-2/4/2012. In retaliation, Russia primary imageboard Biggest, 2ch.so, suffered a DDoS. Some time it was still active, but by morning the 1gbit DDoS did its job.
Feb 4. DDoS-attack also crash 2ch.so, and other big Russian imageboards including 1chan.ru, lulzne.ws, and 0chan.ru. Anons in turn crashed sites Nashi.su, Kremlin.ru, and some other goverment sites. 

As a result Russian channers from 2ch.so, and 0chan.ru immigrated to 4chan’s /int/ board. Currently as of 2/9/2011 they’re remained in /int/. There are some plans to move to 4chan’s /b/, but nothing is certain at the moment.

At this moment in time they’re discovering more and more interesting information in the e-mails that was discovered Also, russian anons also discovered logins and passwords of corporative side of some biggest mass media corporations in Russia.

The real mystery is that why 2ch.so moved to 4chan's /int/ board? One possible theory is that krautchan's /int/ board don't want them here.
