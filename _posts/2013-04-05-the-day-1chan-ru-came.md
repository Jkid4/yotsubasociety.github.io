On February 28, 2013, I’ve uploaded a video of my third panel to Katsucon entitled The Imageboard World 2 – The Chanverse. A few weeks after the video was uploaded on YouTube the first comments came. Most of them came from reddit from r/4chan and r/cringe. Many of the comments were overwhelming focused on the presentation and the autism of the speaker and not on the actual content of the panel. 

But something interesting happened, due to the fact that I put in Russian imageboard search tags such as 0chan and iichan.ru on the video the channers from 1chan.ru came.  The Russian channers saw the video and along with it came the Russian comments. I wanted to see where the links are comng from and they came from the Russian chanverse news site, 1chan.ru  As a matter of fact, the thread actually still exist: http://1chan.ru/news/res/1827742/

Due to the discovery, a few Russian channers emailed me and some of them came to the IRC chatroom (#YotsubaSociety), for a bit of a history lesson.
You’ll see this history lesson in the next article.
