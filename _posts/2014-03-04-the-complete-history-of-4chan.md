The YSwiki had a ongoing timeline of major events that occured on 4chan from 2003 to 2012. It was based on the former Wikichan's The Complete History of 4chan which had a timeline of events from 2003 to 2007. I picked up on the timeline added events from 2003 to 2012. Sadly the YSwiki was down due to rampant spamming from leetchan. But other sites picked up on the project. But I managed to did a few updates on the timeline and I can finally present it to you on this website via a PDF document.

If you have anything that you want to update or if it needs to be in a dedicated page without a PDF, let me know.
