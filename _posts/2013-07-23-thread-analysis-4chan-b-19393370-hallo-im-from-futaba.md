A Toshiaki from Futaba Channel comes to /b/ to learn more Otaku in the Western World. He asks two questions:” Do people have bad image for Otaku? And do people treat you as a stupid or strange person?” Within the thread with usual troll replies and meme spam, there was some insights from /b/tards about Otaku Culture in other countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Australia. 

On January 21st, 2007 a random Toshiaki from Futaba channel posted a thread asking two questions to know about views of otaku in the Western world. He asks two questions: First, do people have a bad image for Otaku and Second, do people treat them as stupid or strange people?  /b/tards from Russia, the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, and Canada did provide insightful answers about otaku culture in their respective countries despite the obvious troll posts, racist posts, and desu spam.

All of the thread replies were anonymous due to the forced anonyminty that was implemented on /b/ in 2007. In addition, there were two other threads posted on Futaba Channel that are also available to view untranslated.

The thread is interesting to note because despite the meme spamming, there is worthwhile discussion and views of Otakuism in Various Countries, the meaning of being an otaku, the separation of their real life self’s and their internet self’s. The thread is too long for me to do a complete detailed analysis, but it’s still worth a read.

<u>Thread notes</u>

<b>Otakuism in Various Countries</b>

The thread offered different perspectives of otakuism from various countries the /b/tards come from. How they got into the anime/otaku culture. The stereotypes of otaku depending on where they live, how their normal routine of otakuism, and how they treat other otaku.

In Britain except for a few stereotypes, Japanese culture is largely unknown/underground except for a few stereotypes.  The only hint of the stereotypes is if you act “all obsessed with Japan and stuff” (/b/,19394096). So it’s easy to suppress your “power level”. However only people who will negatively care are the idiots who are chavs, “that listen to gangster rap and wear tracksuits dislike us” (/b/,19394145).

Many other “otaku” in countries outside of japan are sadly not into a normal life. They rather go to Japan, despite knowing nothing about the language or culture except what they see on Cartoon Network (/b/, 19394258). But as long they don’t get into a living stereotype, they won’t be disliked.

In one unknown country, there is an obvious bias against these type of people. 

<i>whenever there's a show or report on otaku (of any kind), it's humorous or disparaging. And in everyday life, saying that you really like anime can be a bad idea. Hardcore anime fans are seen as socially inept, living in a fantasy etc.</i> – 19394492

In Russia, they’re do have anime clubs and they actually have people who are willing to help people who want to be part of otakuism. (19394631,/b/) And television ten years before 2007 – 1996/1997 anime in Russia, did that happen?  It’s not from Japan. So it has to be from Latin America.

One way that a person gets into otakuism is through tv. Then they discover manga and buying, “videotapes from fansubbers” (19394670, /b/ ) Others get into the otaku culture by of all things: Science fictions cons. Though (19394732) in some countries they considered watch cartoons as “childish” --19394814

In Germany- Anime is trendy among teens. But adults are unaware of adult otaku. In Germany the word otaku is used for liking anime/japan positively.  One reason because it’s narrow interests.  America is a mixed bag – As long you are not obvious. Some people think that anime is for children, and people older than 12 are expected to watch older mature shows (read: Crime/legal/medical/teen dramas and sitcoms)

<b>What is an Otaku?</b>

<i>The closest English word for 'Otaku' is 'nerd'. There are several types of nerds here, as there are several type of Otaku in japan. Nerds are just stereotyped as being smart and unable to socialize. – 19394587</i> 

Why unable to socialize? Is it because they reject mainstream life, or because they’ve been rejected by the mainstream?

<i>No.19394825</i>

The Internet has a great ability to bring people with common interests together. As a result, making several people feel more acceptable with their odd behaviors and hobbies. 

<i>as for myself, i have pride in myself being a nerd (otaku pride). before the Internet, most people were ashamed that they were a nerd. Now, there is a community for us, which is nearly the entire Internet.</i>

<i>No.19394911</i>.

<i>>>19394814</i>

<i>Well it all depends really. In America acting all "in your face" about being an "otaku" would be, and is considered strange.</i> 

<i>Basically if you act stupid, you'll be treated as if you are stupid.</i> 

<i>America is rather conformist, so people tend to call others strange</i>. 

<i>Basically the image can be good or bad. On one hand you have the "otaku" (fan) who works, has a boyfriend, and a sucessful life, on the other you have the overweight looser who lives in a basement and only eats fast food. (This stereotype is actually quite common in real life here)</i>

<b>Weeaboo and Japanophile.</b>

<i>One /b/tard considers Japanophiles and Weeaboo are one and the same. (/b/,19394096)</i>

<i>Two types of otaku – The normal type and the overweight looser</i>

Obviously in America there are many well-adjusted otaku who have lives. They’re just into anime and manage instead of shitty American television. However this reply mentions two types of otaku: The overweight loser and the somewhat unmainstream type.

<i>"otaku" in the sense of "sub-genius with a mind for the perverse and lesser desirable (to the mainstream) side of life, most often a sharp-tongued and quick-witted master of technology, but most likely still lives in hermitage" = well.., slightly less fa­­il. – 19395398</i>

Sadly the overweight otaku is the most visible of the otaku types in the US. Despite the fact that people who is otaku are not like that. However, those otaku are the silent ones, those who keep their visibility in check to preserve their public lives. Due to this, the most visible are the most ones the public identify with.  However currently to the Russian public, in some cities, it’s unpopular.

<b>An Alternative moot-tan?</b>

The most common moot-tan most people are into is a one that is represented as a cat with a bow with underwear. It’s the well-known of the gijinkazation of the founder. It has been represented in many forms since the introduction. However, there is one other moot tan that is rarely seen.

It actually looks more human than moot tan. I do have the image but I can't seem to find it in my hard drives.
