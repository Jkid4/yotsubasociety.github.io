Remember back in 2011 about restoring the old wikichan (http://www.yotsubasociety.org/news_update_5_23_2011)and our plans to integrate it with the Yotsuba Society Wiki? 

Yeah, we did it. Well mostly me, with a bit of help with TheShadowFog and dabeshu. The project was started during Winter break on January 2012. Despite the call to action on the yswiki about the project, only two people did some of the help. I did most of the work myself in between going to and from school. Slowly I worked my way through one row to another. It took me four months to complete the project. Great majority of the time it was straight copy and paste work, some of them involved simple wiki markup. In some instances, there’s also the fact that it took a bit more mark up to get things straighten out. 

Despite the setbacks, I can safely say that we are effectively done with the project.

With the exception of Blindmute Loli, most of the Holders series, The Well-Culture Guide of Anonymous, the uncultured guide of anonymous, and the nurse-kun stories, and some other long articles that are too complicated for me as a novice webmaster to deal with.  But they’re available to view on yswiki.org. 

With this set of articles we can use them as a base for the YSwiki for accurate information of history and culture of the chanverse. Not to mention we can continue where wikichan left off by expanding what wikichan documented and we can document the present with it.

We definitely got a long way to go to exceed that.
