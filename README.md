# Yotsuba Society Website

This is the new Jekyll/Minimal-Mistakes based Yotsuba Society website, created by the [Bibliotheca Anonoma](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki) to replace the rotting Drupal 7.x website they used to use. Sometimes, even the archivists need to be archived.

And don't worry, all the old pagelinks and downloads still work (we worked hard to make that possible), so no need to change your bookmarks.

## Getting Started

Minimal Mistakes takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require Jekyll 2.x and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/) for more information.

```

Now, you can write your blog post in Markdown format below the FrontMatter Check out Github's excellent [Markdown Tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) to get a feel for this powerful markup language.
